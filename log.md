# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a vanilla HTML version of my personal website (cooperhollmaier.com). Will continue building in content and then include some robust CSS to make it look great.

**Thoughts:** It's nice to get back into the code site of development. I've been enjoying applying my accessibility knowledge and organizing my thoughts into blocks of code. Most of my work recently has been heavily based in JavaScript. It's nice to get back to basics.

### Day 5: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back to basics after deciding that I didn't really want all the features I had added. Redefined by goals for the page and rewrote some sections.

**Thoughts:** I tend to prefer a cleaner site that has a defined goal rather than a bunch of flashy things that don't add much real value to a user.

### Day 6: April 26, 2020
