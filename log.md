# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:
Today's Progress: Worked on a vanilla HTML version of my personal website (cooperhollmaier.com). Will continue building in content and then include some robust CSS to make it look great.

Thoughts: It's nice to get back into the code site of development. I've been enjoying applying my accessibility knowledge and organizing my thoughts into blocks of code. Most of my work recently has been heavily based in JavaScript. It's nice to get back to basics.

### Day 3:
Today's Progress: Continued to work on the CSS for my personal site and add menu JS functionality

### Day 5:
Today's Progress: Breaking my CSS one line at a time. Need to continue to work on styling until I have things settled down at all breakpoints.

Thoughts: Merp. Feeling like I went backwards :)

### Day 6:
Today's Progress: Went back to basics after deciding that I didn't really want all the features I had added. Redefined by goals for the page and rewrote some sections.

Thoughts: I tend to prefer a cleaner site that has a defined goal rather than a bunch of flashy things that don't add much real value to a user.

### Day 7:
Today's Progress: No much to be honest. Felt like I messed around with CSS for a while and then reverted it all.

Thoughts: I need to more clearly define my goals before starting.

### Day 8:
Today's Progress: Completely rebuilt the page from the ground up. Refactored the CSS into a much easier to digest format and removed my crazy thinking.

Thoughts: Much happier today with how things are looking.

### Day 9:
Today's Progress: Built a header for the website based on some design work I did. Also updated the favicon and built a sitemap for search engines

### Day 10:

### Day 13:
Today's Progress: Fixed some accessibility concerns on the footer and added to the speaking page.

### Day 14:
Today's Progress: Started building article cards on the thoughts section of the blog. Played around with the color pallete and article tagging.

Thoughts: It's starting to come together but feels a bit plain and I'm not sold on the color pallete I've chosen. Link to work: https://cooperhollmaier.com
### Day 15:
Today's Progress: Cleaned up the tags on the thoughts section and updated some old code that needed to be cleaned up.

### Day 17:
Today's Progress: Cleaned up some more styling, added social meta data to every page, and started thinking about content for the thoughts section.

### Day 22:
Today's Progress: Eliminated font awesome dependency (no more fa.css or calls to that font library), cleaned up my custom properties and unused CSS.

Thoughts: Feeling good about performance. Found a video that I can follow along with to potentially write an app that will pull in my Strava data from the API and then I can add it to the DOM.

### Day 26:
Today's Progress: Didn't get much done. Played around with the adventures page some, but not really sure what I want to do with it.

Thoughts: Need a broad plan for adventures before I develop on it more.

### Day 27:

Today's Progress: Clean-up of code today. Made the site a bit faster and removed some more dependancies

### Day 29:
Today's Progress: Decided to scrap the adventures page for now and instead working on compiling a page with all the projects I've worked on.
